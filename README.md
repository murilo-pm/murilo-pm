I'm currently studying Letters at USP (University of São Paulo). In addition, I've completed a full stack web development course at Generation Brazil. Nowadays I'm looking to improve not just myself but also my abilities in programming so that I can start my professional career in the technology field and, in the future, get started with computational linguistics and AI. Feel free to contact me whenever you need, no matter what.
